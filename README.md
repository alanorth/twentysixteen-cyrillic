# Twenty Sixteen Cyrillic
A child theme of [Twenty Sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/) that is exactly the same in every way, but utilizes different fonts to have better coverage for Cyrillic script.

The default fonts used in Twenty Sixteen (Merriweather, Montserrat, and Inconsolata) have no Cyrillic support, which causes the web browser to use a system font for those characters and creates an inconsistent visual experience (see [#30](https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen/issues/30)). Instead, I use Mozilla's [Fira Sans](http://www.carrois.com/fira-4-1/) and Fira Mono typefacesâ€”they are modern, open source, and have much better Cyrillic coverage.
