# Twenty Sixteen Cyrillic
A child theme of [Twenty Sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/) that is exactly the same in every way, but utilizes different fonts to have better coverage for Cyrillic script.

The default fonts used in Twenty Sixteen are Merriweather, Montserrat, and Inconsolata, none of which have support for Cyrillic. I've replaced these with Fira Sans and Fira Mono, two modern, open-source fonts with great Cyrillc coverage.
